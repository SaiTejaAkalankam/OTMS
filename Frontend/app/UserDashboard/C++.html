<h1>C++ OOPs Concepts</h1>
<p>The major purpose of C++ programming is to introduce the concept of object orientation to the C programming language.</p>

<p>Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.</p>

<p>The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as truly object-oriented programming language. Smalltalk is considered as the first truly object-oriented programming language.</p>

<h1>OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)</h1>
<p>Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Object</li>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Abstraction</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
</ol>
<h1>Object</h1>
<p>Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.</p>

<h1>Class</h1>
<p>Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.</p>

<h1>Inheritance</h1>
<p>When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.</p>

<h1>Polymorphism</h1>
<p>When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.</p>

<p>In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.</p>

<h1>Abstraction</h1>
<p>Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.</p>

<p>In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.</p>

<h1>Encapsulation</h1>
<p>Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.</p>

<h1>Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language</h1>
<p>OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.</p>
<p>OOPs provide data hiding whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language a global data can be accessed from anywhere.</p>
<p>OOPs provide ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.</p>
